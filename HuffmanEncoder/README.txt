Steps to run:
  1.Install Node.js 
  2.In terminal navigate to project directory.
  3.Execute:  node ./main.js <full path to .txt input file>
<->Example: node "./Assignment 4/main.js" "C:/Users/user1/Desktop/js/Assignment 4/data/hamlet.txt"

   To run UnitTests, run Dictionary.UnitTests.js
<->Example: node "./Assignment 4/Dictionary.UnitTests.js"

   You can also try running script on "test.txt". It has the same resulting binary codes as in assignment instructions example.
<->Example:  node "./Assignment 4/main.js" "C:/Users/user1/Desktop/js/Assignment 4/data/test.txt"  
   Example in pdf instructions: TOBEORNOTTOBETHATISTHEBANANA

Script outputs following values to help with debug: 
 -- Character Weight
 -- Order of combining subtrees (When "/n" and "/r" are added output starts looking weird but its okay)
 -- Resulting binary codes
